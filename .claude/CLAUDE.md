## Active Feature
Feature: sun-tracker-v2
Spec: .spec/sun-tracker-v2/requirements.md, design.md
Tasks: .spec/sun-tracker-v2/tasks/
Current task: .spec/sun-tracker-v2/tasks/task-002.md
Branch: feature/sun-tracker-v2

## Start Here
1. Read `## Active Feature` above — note the current task path.
2. Open the current task file — it is self-contained.
3. Skills are already loaded via @imports above — no need to load them manually.
4. Implement. Run `/task-handoff` when done.

## Reference (load on demand — do not read at session start)
- Agents: `.claude/agents/` — invoke with `@agent-name`; use only when task specifies
- Commands: `.claude/commands/` — key ones: `/verify`, `/task-handoff`, `/save-session`, `/tdd`, `/code-review`
- Config: `.claude/project-config.md` — deployment targets, env vars, hosting
- Rules: `.claude/rules/` — applied automatically

## Bug Log
Append to `bug-log.md` immediately after any fix:
`## [YYYY-MM-DD] title | What broke: … | Root cause: … | Fix: … | File(s): …`

## Self-Check (before marking task done)
1. Acceptance Criteria in current task file — all pass?
2. Hardcoded values that should be env vars?
3. Upstream/downstream breakage?
4. `bug-log.md` updated if errors occurred?

## Output Discipline
Lead with the action. No preamble, no post-summary. Bullet points over prose.
