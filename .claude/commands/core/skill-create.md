# /skill-create - Local Skill Generation

Analyze your repository's git history to extract coding patterns and generate SKILL.md files that teach Claude your team's practices.

## Usage

```bash
/skill-create                    # Analyze current repo
/skill-create --commits 100      # Analyze last 100 commits
/skill-create --output ./skills  # Custom output directory
/skill-create --instincts        # Also generate instincts for continuous-learning-v2
```

## What It Does

1. **Parses Git History** - Analyzes commits, file changes, and patterns
2. **Detects Patterns** - Identifies recurring workflows and conventions
3. **Generates SKILL.md** - Creates valid Claude Code skill files
4. **Optionally Creates Instincts** - For the continuous-learning-v2 system

## Analysis Steps

### Step 1: Gather Git Data

```bash
# Get recent commits with file changes
git log --oneline -n ${COMMITS:-200} --name-only --pretty=format:"%H|%s|%ad" --date=short

# Get commit frequency by file
git log --oneline -n 200 --name-only | grep -v "^$" | grep -v "^[a-f0-9]" | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20

# Get commit message patterns
git log --oneline -n 200 | cut -d' ' -f2- | head -50
```

### Step 2: Detect Patterns

Look for these pattern types:

| Pattern | Detection Method |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Commit conventions** | Regex on commit messages (feat:, fix:, chore:) |
| **File co-changes** | Files that always change together |
| **Workflow sequences** | Repeated file change patterns |
| **Architecture** | Folder structure and naming conventions |
| **Testing patterns** | Test file locations, naming, coverage |

### Step 3: Generate SKILL.md

**Cost-efficiency rules (apply before writing):**

| Rule | Target |
|------|--------|
| Total lines | ≤150 (80–120 ideal) |
| Sections | Actionable directives only — no preamble, no introductions |
| General knowledge | Remove any section that is >80% what Claude already knows |
| Format | Tables over prose; `**Rule:**` callouts over inline explanations |

Run a cost check: if estimated output exceeds 150 lines, cut lowest-value sections first. Never explain concepts Claude already knows (e.g., what JSON is, what a function is).

Output format:

```markdown
---
name: {repo-name}-patterns
description: Coding patterns extracted from {repo-name}
version: 1.0.0
source: local-git-analysis
analyzed_commits: {count}
---

# {Repo Name} Patterns

## Commit Conventions
{detected commit message patterns}

## Code Architecture
{detected folder structure and organization}

## Workflows
{detected repeating file change patterns}

## Testing Patterns
{detected test conventions}
```

### Step 3b: Cost-Efficiency Check

Before writing the file:
1. Count estimated lines in the draft
2. If >150: identify and remove the sections with the lowest unique value (general workflow advice, concept explanations, boilerplate commentary)
3. Verify every remaining section contains at least one directive that changes Claude's behavior — if not, cut it

### Step 4: Generate Instincts (if --instincts)

For continuous-learning-v2 integration:

```yaml
---
id: {repo}-commit-convention
trigger: "when writing a commit message"
confidence: 0.8
domain: git
source: local-repo-analysis
---

# Use Conventional Commits

## Action
Prefix commits with: feat:, fix:, chore:, docs:, test:, refactor:

## Evidence
- Analyzed {n} commits
- {percentage}% follow conventional commit format
```

## Example Output

Running `/skill-create` on a TypeScript project might produce:

```markdown
---
name: my-app-patterns
description: Coding patterns from my-app repository
version: 1.0.0
source: local-git-analysis
analyzed_commits: 150
---

# My App Patterns

## Commit Conventions

This project uses **conventional commits**:
- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks
- `docs:` - Documentation updates

## Code Architecture

```
src/
├── components/     # React components (PascalCase.tsx)
├── hooks/          # Custom hooks (use*.ts)
├── utils/          # Utility functions
├── types/          # TypeScript type definitions
└── services/       # API and external services
```

## Workflows

### Adding a New Component
1. Create `src/components/ComponentName.tsx`
2. Add tests in `src/components/__tests__/ComponentName.test.tsx`
3. Export from `src/components/index.ts`

### Database Migration
1. Modify `src/db/schema.ts`
2. Run `pnpm db:generate`
3. Run `pnpm db:migrate`

## Testing Patterns

- Test files: `__tests__/` directories or `.test.ts` suffix
- Coverage target: 80%+
- Framework: Vitest
```

## GitHub App Integration

For advanced features (10k+ commits, team sharing, auto-PRs), use the [Skill Creator GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/skill-creator):

- Install: [github.com/apps/skill-creator](https://github.com/apps/skill-creator)
- Comment `/skill-creator analyze` on any issue
- Receives PR with generated skills

## Related Commands

- `/instinct-import` - Import generated instincts
- `/instinct-status` - View learned instincts
- `/evolve` - Cluster instincts into skills/agents
